# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project identifies whether a news article is fake or real using Natural Language Processing and supervised learning models.

## 🔍 Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall

## 📁 Dataset
Used the Fake and Real News Dataset from Kaggle:
- `train.csv`: for training the model
- `test.csv`: for testing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
2. Install dependencies  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run the notebook or script in `src/`
